# Analyze-IP-Adress-of-ESP8266
ESP8266 WiFi Module

ESP8266 is Wi-Fi enabled system on chip (SoC) module developed by Espressif system. It is mostly used for development of IoT (Internet of Things) embedded applications.

Most people prefer to get ESP8266 IP address on serial monitor. But in many cases it is difficult to have serial connection always connected and having display for just to know ip address.

Home automation
Easy to attach switchboard for home automation will help us to control all the switches of the home from any place. You just need Google Assistant in
your phone and the kit. Then you are good to go to save the electricity and your precious time. In the current scenarios we need to opt smart lights for the
purpose. But this technology will surely solve the problem of not having costly smart appliances and can turn anything smart.
Switching all the swtichboard of any room by attaching relay at switch, basically an adapter at every board. It would then be connected to the main wifi
network with help of wifi module, providing it the internet access. It will be connected together for operating through your phone now. 
After receiving the
command, the respective relay would trigger and work for the required function. We would use wifi module ESP 8266 for internal signal connectivity.
Arduino nano processor would be used and battery if needed.
Relay for switching.
